## 📖 Overview

**npnameyrapp** is an interactive Shiny application designed to support National Park and protected-area staff in managing and preparing wildlife monitoring databases, particularly camera trap data.

The development of **npnameyrapp v1.1** was **directly shaped by collaboration and field-based contributions** from the **Wildlife Conservation Centre (WCC), Universitas Gadjah Mada**, as well as park staff, users, and practitioners involved in the activity *“Camera Trap Data Management Using the npnameyrapp v1.0-master Application”*, held at **Baluran National Park, Situbondo, East Java (5 December 2025)**. Feedback from this activity informed both design decisions and feature priorities in the current version.

WCC UGM also supported the **public launch** of the application through their official website [official website](https://satwaliar.fkt.ugm.ac.id/2025/12/25/app-launch-npnameyrapp-untuk-monitoring-satwa-liar/), contributing institutional backing and facilitating wider dissemination. Real-world use cases, operational constraints, and practitioner feedback were essential in refining workflows, improving usability, and expanding functionality from v1.0 to v1.1.  

As a **community-driven, open-source project**, npnameyrapp grows through shared experience between developers, conservation practitioners, and researchers. Field insights and practical challenges reported by users play a central role in ensuring the application remains relevant, robust, and responsive to conservation monitoring needs. 

We welcome contributions in many forms—including **code development, documentation, testing, feature suggestions, and field feedback**. Whether you are a ranger, researcher, student, or developer, your contributions help strengthen wildlife monitoring capacity and support evidence-based decisions for species persistence and ecosystem resilience.

# Upgrade npnameyrapp v1.0 → v1.1  

## What’s New  

Version 1.1 introduces workflow automation, improved usability, and expanded analytical features.  
Many of these updates were informed by real-world use cases and feedback from practitioners during field-based training and deployment.

---

### App1  — Data Preparation & Table Construction

- **Auto-folder creation**  
  Automatically generates the required folder structure and input paths, reducing manual setup and path errors.

- **Image + Video integration (Hybrid CT data)**  
  Supports combined processing of image and video files when building camera trap tables, enabling more flexible workflows.

---

### App2  — Analysis & Interpretation

- **Auto-folder creation**  
  Automatically creates its own working directories and input paths for downstream analyses.

- **Data preview**  
  Allows previewing **100–1000 rows** of processed data from App1 before analysis.

- **Species-input auto-fill**  
  Automatically populates the *Species-input* column using the species tag list, supporting standardized naming and **GBIF validation**.

- **Activity overlap plots (two species)**  
  Adds an option to visualize daily activity overlap between two selected species.

- **Overlap coefficient estimation**  
  Estimates overlap coefficients for a single species pair, using automatic estimator selection and confidence interval methods.

- **Bootstrap customization**  
  Allows users to define the number of bootstrap iterations (**1,000–10,000**) and generates a summary table of confidence intervals.

---

### General Improvements  

- **Automatic package check at startup**  
  When opening the project in RStudio, npnameyrapp v1.1 automatically checks whether all required packages for App1 and App2 are available.

  - ✅ No manual setup required if all packages are already installed  
  - ❌ Clear installation instructions are shown in the console if packages are missing  
  - ⚠️ RStudio opens normally even when packages are missing  
  - 📋 Step-by-step console messages guide users until completion, ending with:  
    *“All packages are ready. You can now launch the app.”*

## Introduction
The **npnameyrapp** application was developed to help National Park staff (or staff of other protected areas) carry out wildlife monitoring tasks using camera traps—especially for staff who are not yet familiar with R coding.  

It provides a partially interactive interface that implements workflows from:  
- **camtrapR** ([CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/camtrapR/)) for processing raw field data into tabulated record tables.  
- **overlap** ([CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/overlap/)) for analyzing species daily activity patterns.  
- **RPresence** (`install.packages('RPresence', repos='https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/mbrCRAN')`) for static occupancy analysis (single species – single season).  

The application consists of two sub-applications run separately and sequentially:  
- **App1** ("script/launch-v1-1/RUN-appV1_1.R")  
- **App2** ("script/launch-v1-1/RUN-app2V1_1.R")  

**Inputs:**  
- App1 requires two datasets: `data/CTmonitoring` and `data/ctTable`.  
- App2 requires one input file: `App1_output.RData` (generated by App1).

## Download & Extract ZIP File
Download `npnameyrapp-master.zip`, then extract it into `C:/Users/ACER` (or any folder of your choice).  

Open `npnameyrapp.Rproj` to launch RStudio with the working directory set to:  

C:/Users/ACER/npnameyrapp

---

## Launch App
Open `script/launch-v1-1/RUN-appV1_1.R` in RStudio and execute each line (`Ctrl + Enter`). 

The script is divided into three parts:  
1. **Working Directory** – `getwd()` ensures the directory is `C:/Users/ACER/npnameyrapp`.  
2. **Packages** – `library()` loads required R packages.  
3. **App Launcher** –  
   ```r
   source("KEY_APP2/launch-app.R")    # initializes the application 1
   source("KEY_APP2/launch-app2.R")   # initializes the application 2

   shinyApp(ui, server)             # opens the app
  
> The procedure for launching App1 and App2 is the same.

---

## Running the Application

Both applications contain several “layers” grouped into two categories:

1. **USER-INPUT layers**
2. **USER-PROCESSING layers**

---

### App1

#### USER-INPUT Layers

**Opening**
- `setwd()` – confirm the working directory  
- `inDir` – `<working_directory>/data/CTmonitoring`  
- `outDir` – `<working_directory>/data/CTmonitoring_rename`  
- `excel_outdir` – `<working_directory>/workdir`  
- **EXIFTOOL Path** – folder containing `exiftool.exe` (e.g., `C:/Windows`)  

**Fig 1. App1 — Opening (layer input: PATH)**

### ⚠️ Critical Steps for Video Files

If your **CT Data Folder contains video files**, you **must** follow this sequence before launching the app:

1. **Extract the ZIP file** to set up the expected folder structure.  
2. **Introduce `CTmonitoring` folder to DigiKam as albums**  
   - Install and launch DigiKam.  
   - Go to **Settings → Configure DigiKam → Collections → Root Albums Folders**.  
   - Add local collection → Browse to `CTmonitoring` folder → OK.  
3. **Re‑species name tag all video files**  
   - In DigiKam’s left tab menu → Albums → select the video station folder.  
   - Apply correct species name tags to all video files → click **Apply**.  
4. **Find and note the DigiKam database path**  
   - Go to **Settings → Configure DigiKam → Collections → Database**.  
   - Copy the path (e.g., `D:\digikam`).  
   - This folder contains:  
     - `digikam4.db`  
     - `recognition.db`  
     - `similarity.db`  
     - `thumbnails-digikam.db`  
5. **Close DigiKam**  
   - The species name tags will be written automatically into DigiKam’s temporary files.  
6. **Launch the app safely**  
   - Now you can run the app with video included.  

> **✅ Why this is important**  
> - Ensures **species metadata is correctly embedded** in video files before the app processes them.  
> - Prevents errors when `recordTable()` reads video metadata.  
> - Keeps the workflow reproducible for both old and new users.
